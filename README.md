HangryFix is a web app that presents users with restaurants in their desired locations. Users can rate the meals they had in those restaurants. Owners can add their own restaurant to the website for users to view. Based on the reviews they left on the restaurants, the website recommends some other restaurants to the users using a machine learning recommendation system.
